This directory contains 2 examples to create your own TTree using a class (and
Fun4All). The sources are in ./src, the macros to run the show are in ./macros.

The MySimpleTree class is stored in a TTree by itself and then inside a
TClonesArray (just to show you that the MySimpleTree class doesn't need any
modifications for the TClonesArray).

Unlike our DST's there is no virtual base class to keep old files readable 
after you change the content of your class. It's not difficult to add this 
feature but I wanted to keep it straight and simple.
